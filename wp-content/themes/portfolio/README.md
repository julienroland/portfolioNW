# Playmaker

## Summary:

The Playmaker Wordpress theme is a boilerplate theme based on the [HTML5 Reset templates](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset). Build with [ZURB's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework and sass ready it's a great jumping off point upon which to build your own HTML5-based responsive Wordpress themes.
If you are used to working with foundation, getting into this theme should be no sweat.

## ZURB

## HTML5 Reset
##### The "why" of HTML5 Reset

Like a lot of developers, we start every HTML project with the same set of HTML and CSS files. We've been using these files for a long time and have progressively added bits and pieces to them as our own personal best practices have evolved.

Now that modern browsers are starting to support some of the really useful parts of HTML5 and CSS3, it's time for our best practices to catch up, and we thought we'd put our files out there for everyone to use. By no means do we see this as the One True Way to start every project, but we think it's a good starting place that anyone can make their own.
